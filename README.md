## 📝 Usage Notes
- **Role-based routing:** Users are redirected to their dashboard after login.
- **Admin:** Full access to all management features.
- **Doctor:** Can view/manage their appointments, patients, labs, and more.
- **Patient:** Can view appointments, doctors, medicines, labs, and request ambulance.
- **Medicines:** All patients see all available medicines (no patient-specific filtering yet).
- **API Proxy:** The frontend uses a Vite proxy to connect to the backend (`/api/*` routes).

---

## 📚 Customization & Extending
- To add patient-specific medicines, implement a patient-medicine relationship in the backend and expose an endpoint like `/api/pharmacy/patient/:id`.
- To add more granular permissions, implement route protection using a PrivateRoute/ProtectedRoute component.
- Easily extend dashboards with more widgets, analytics, or management features.
